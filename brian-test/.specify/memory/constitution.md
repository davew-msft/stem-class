# Static Web App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Static-First Architecture
All content must be pre-built at build time; Dynamic content limited to client-side JavaScript and API calls; No server-side rendering except during build process

### II. Performance Standards
Initial page load under 3 seconds; Core Web Vitals must pass; Assets must be optimized (minified, compressed, cached)

### III. Mobile-First Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Responsive design mandatory; Touch-friendly interfaces; Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop

### IV. Accessibility Compliance
WCAG 2.1 AA standards minimum; Semantic HTML required; Keyboard navigation support mandatory



## Technology Constraints

Static site generators preferred (Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, Next.js static export); CDN deployment required; Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities recommended; Cross-browser compatibility (modern browsers only)

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all design decisions; Performance budgets must be enforced; All deployments require successful build validation; Breaking accessibility standards blocks deployment
