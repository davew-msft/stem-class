# Educational Notes:
# ============================================================================
# 
# Why exclude these files?
# 1. Security: Never include .env files or secrets
# 2. Size: Smaller images download and start faster
# 3. Cache: Better layer caching = faster builds
# 4. Clean: Only production-necessary files
#
# Check what's being copied:
# docker build -t test . --progress=plain
#
# View image layers and size:
# docker history rescan:v1.0.0
