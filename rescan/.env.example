# Rescan - Educational Environment Configuration
# ===============================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: This is a template file showing what environment variables are needed.
# Copy this file to '.env' and fill in your actual values.
# NEVER commit your real .env file with secrets!
#
# Educational Learning: Environment variables keep sensitive information 
# separate from your code, making applications secure and deployable.

# === Server Configuration ===
# Port number where your Express server will listen
# Educational note: 3000 is a common development port
PORT=3000

# === Database Configuration ===
# SQLite database file path
# Educational note: SQLite stores everything in a single file
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/rescan.db

# === Azure OpenAI Configuration (REQUIRED) ===
# Get these from your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal
# Educational note: API keys authenticate your app to external services

# Your Azure OpenAI API Key (looks like: sk-proj-...)
# THIS IS SECRET - Never share this key!
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (looks like: https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_here

# Azure OpenAI model deployment name (usually 'gpt-4-vision-preview' or similar)
# What you named your GPT-4V deployment in Azure
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o

# === Educational Configuration ===
# Set to 'true' to enable detailed logging for learning
# This shows students more information about how the app works
EDUCATIONAL_MODE=true

# Set to 'development' for detailed error messages
# In production, this would be 'production' to hide sensitive error details
NODE_ENV=development

# === File Upload Limits ===
# Maximum file size for image uploads (in bytes)
# Educational note: 5MB = 5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880

# Maximum number of concurrent requests to process
# Educational note: Limits prevent overwhelming the AI service
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=5

# ===============================================
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# ===============================================
# 1. Copy this file to '.env' (remove the .example)
# 2. Ask your instructor for the Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint
# 3. Fill in the AZURE_OPENAI_* values
# 4. Run 'npm run db:setup' to create the SQLite database
# 5. Run 'npm run dev' to start the development server
# 
# Troubleshooting:
# - If you get "API key not found" errors, check your .env file
# - If database errors occur, try 'npm run db:reset'
# - Ask classmates or instructor if you get stuck!
