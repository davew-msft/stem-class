# Rescan - Educational .gitignore for Node.js Project
# =================================================
# This file tells git which files and folders to ignore when tracking changes.
# Educational focus: Learn about version control best practices

# === Node.js Dependencies ===
# node_modules contains all downloaded packages from npm install
# Never commit these - they're huge and can be recreated with 'npm install'
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# === Environment Configuration ===
# .env files contain secrets like API keys and database passwords
# Never commit real secrets to version control!
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# === Database Files ===
# SQLite journal/temp files should not be committed
# The main .db file IS committed so it ships with Docker and new clones
data/*.db-journal
data/*.db-wal
data/*.db-shm

# === Temporary Files ===
# Uploaded images are processed then deleted - no need to track
backend/public/uploads/*
# Keep the directory but not the contents
!backend/public/uploads/.gitkeep

# === Scan Uploads ===
# Keep the scans-uploads directory (via .gitkeep) but ignore all contents
scans-uploads/*
!scans-uploads/.gitkeep

# === Build Output ===
# Compiled/minified files that are generated from source
dist/
build/

# === IDE and Editor Files ===
# VS Code settings (we keep some for educational setup)
.vscode/settings.json
.vscode/launch.json
# But keep educational workspace settings
!.vscode/extensions.json
!.vscode/tasks.json

# === System Files ===
# Operating system generated files
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db

# === Testing ===
# Coverage reports and test output
coverage/
.nyc_output

# === Logs ===
# Application logs (we keep educational logging in console)
*.log
logs/

# === Docker & Kubernetes ===
# Docker and Kubernetes configuration (keep templates, exclude secrets)
# Keep: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, k8s/*.yaml templates
k8s/secret.yaml
# Exclude real secrets - only commit .example files
*.secret.yaml
!*.secret.yaml.example

# === Documentation ===
# Keep all educational documentation for learning
# (Nothing excluded here - all docs are valuable for learning)

# === Educational Notes ===
# This gitignore helps students understand:
# 1. What files are safe to share publicly
# 2. Security considerations (API keys, databases)
# 3. Performance considerations (node_modules size)
# 4. Temporary vs. permanent files
