Dave's Notes
-------

Recycling app.  

In chatgpt:

>I'm looking for capabilities of what you can do with your GPT models. If I give you a picture of an object. can you tell me if it is recyclable? tell me more

Output:

Yes — I can help with that. ♻️
If you upload a photo of an object, I can:


Identify the object or material (e.g., plastic bottle, aluminum can, cardboard, etc.)


Analyze recycling symbols or labels on the item (like ♻️ “1 PET” or “5 PP”)


Explain whether and how it can be recycled, based on the material and common recycling guidelines


Offer location-specific advice if you tell me your region or city (since recycling rules vary a lot)


Here’s what I can do:


Visually detect materials, textures, and packaging types.


Read and interpret printed labels or recycling codes from the image.


Cross-reference that info with local or general recycling programs.


Suggest how to prepare it for recycling (e.g., “rinse out food residue,” “remove cap,” “flatten box”).


What I can’t do directly:


I don’t have a built-in database of every city’s recycling rules — but I can look them up in real time.


I can’t confirm recyclability at a specific facility unless it’s publicly listed.


I can’t physically test materials (e.g., to tell if it’s truly biodegradable or compostable).


Would you like to try it out? You can upload a picture of the object, and I’ll walk you through whether it’s recyclable and how to dispose of it properly.

**So this seems possible**
